#### Lesson Summary:

This lesson disccusses support vector machines. Student's learn both some of the motivating intuition and mathematics behind the algorithm as well as how to implement a model using scikit-learn. 

#### Topic:
 
Support Vector Machines

#### Learning goals for this lesson:

* Students will be able to implement a SVM classifier using scikit-learn.
* Students will be able to explain how an SVM classifier chooses a decision boundary by maximizing the margin between datapoints and this hyperplane.
* Students will be able to describe theconcept of a kernel and how it can be applied to SVM classifiers.

#### Prerequisite knowledge:

* Students should have a strong working understanding of Pandas DataFrames.
* Students should have previous exposure to classifiers and their evaluation.
